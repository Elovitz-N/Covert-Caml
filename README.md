# CovertCaml
CovertCaml is a secure messaging service implemented in OCaml. The service consists of a client program and a server program. Instances of the client program connect to the server which handles authenticaiton and message services. Once authenticated to the server, a client can 1) List any new messages sent to them 2) List the users in the database 3) Send a new message to a user or 4) Quit the program. All messages sent between the client and server are encrypted using symmetric key encryption. Username and password authentication is used to identify clients, while a unique public key, private key pair is used to authenticate the server. The server authentication occurs only once while a client is connecting. For security purposes, the server should be located in a locked room to avoid unauthorized access.
