   Academic Integrity Statement

   I, the person named in the author comment above, have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies.  I have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   The policies do permit some limited collaboration among students currently
   enrolled in the course. If I did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom I collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:

   - John Stawinski
   - Likita Gangireddy
   - Nadav Elovitz
   - Ria Vora
